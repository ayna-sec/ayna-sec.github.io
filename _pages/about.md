Hello friends! I'm **Angie Yuliana Naranjo Arias**.

In this blog I share my [Cybersecurity Projects](https://ayna-sec.github.io/categories/#projects){: .btn .btn--primary} as part of my learning journey.

I am transitioning into the cybersecurity field, studying as a SOC Analyst at Hack The Box and having completed a bootcamp at Upgrade hub. I am constantly improving my skills to meet the challenges of the sector. My experience in various industries has allowed me to develop meticulous attention to detail and the skills to work under pressure. I have a strong background in quality management and problem solving.  With a solid foundation in Law from the University of Alicante, I aim to combine my legal knowledge with my technical skills in log analysis, incident response, intelligence and forensic analysis.

My motivation lies in contributing to a secure digital environment, applying my meticulous attention to detail and problem-solving skills in this dynamic technology sector.
